# Pacmen Factory

## Description:

The Pacmen factory was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The project shows how we can manipulate the DOM, creating elements, styling them, and adding them to the window. Also, we can see how setInterval or setTimeout can be used to create animations.

## How to run:

• Clone the respository to your computer
• Open the file index.html
• Click on the Create button and then click start
• Create as much Pacman as you want! =D

• Another way to run it is just visiting the live demo and trying it out!

## Roadmap of future improvements:

• Add a Speed Up and Slow down buttons
• Add different characters to the DOM
